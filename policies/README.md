## Policies

Here we have all the policies we are currently building out, the two main focus differentiators for our templates are MRVs that end with:

- Agrecalc
- Cool Farm Tool 

Inside of each policy folder we have these items:

- The README of the specific policy, with recommendations.
- A directory of example block submissions, assuming that context and schema UUID's will be injected as part of the guardian process
